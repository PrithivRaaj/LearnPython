So here we gonna see about Variables,Data types,Comments,etc..

# What is Variable ?

Variable are the place holders for storing data.

>>X=5 # X is a variable here

There are some set of rules that should followed while declaring variable:

• A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
• A variable name cannot start with a number
• A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and
_ )
• Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
• Inbuilt keywords should not be used as identifiers
