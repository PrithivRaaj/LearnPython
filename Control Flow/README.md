# Control Flow
Control flow is the order in which a computer executes statements in a script. It helps a program make decisions, loop through instructions, and execute code blocks based on conditions. This makes a program dynamic and responsive to different scenarios

# Conditional Statements
The following are the conditional statements provided by Python. 

1. if
2. if..else
3. Nested if
4. if-elif statements.

# if Statement in Python
If the simple code of block is to be performed if the condition holds true then the if statement is used.

Syntax: 

if condition:

#Statements to execute if

#condition is true

# if else Statement in Python

In conditional if Statement the additional block of code is merged as else statement which is performed when if condition is false. 

Syntax: 

if (condition): 

#Executes this block if 

#condition is true

else: 

#Executes this block if 

#condition is false

# Nested if Statement
if statement can also be checked inside other if statement. This conditional statement is called a nested if statement. This means that inner if condition will be checked only if outer if condition is true and by this, we can see multiple conditions to be satisfied.

Syntax: if (condition1): # Executes when condition1 is true if (condition2): # Executes when condition2 is true # if Block is end here# if Block is end here

# if-elif Statement in Python
The if-elif statement is shortcut of if..else chain. While using if-elif statement at the end else block is added which is performed if none of the above if-elif statement is true.

Syntax: if (condition): statementelif (condition): statement..else: statement
