# What is a Dictionary in Python?
Dictionaries in Python is a data structure, used to store values in key:value format. This makes it different from lists, tuples, and arrays as in a dictionary each key has an associated value.
# Create a Dictionary
  * A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by a ‘comma’.
  
  * The dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.
  
  * Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
  * A dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing curly braces{}.
  * Note – Dictionary keys are case sensitive, the same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.

# Adding Elements to a Dictionary
 * The addition of elements can be done in multiple ways. One value at a time can be added to a Dictionary by defining value along with the key e.g. Dict[Key] = ‘Value’.
 
 * Updating an existing value in a Dictionary can be done by using the built-in update() method. Nested key values can also be added to an existing Dictionary.
   
 * Note- While adding a value, if the key-value already exists, the value gets updated otherwise a new Key with the value is added to the Dictionary.
# Accessing Elements of a Dictionary
To access the items of a dictionary refer to its key name. Key can be used inside square brackets. 
   # Accessing an Element of a Nested Dictionary
     To access the value of any key in the nested dictionary, use indexing [] syntax.
