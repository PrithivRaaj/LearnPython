# What is a Dictionary in Python?
Dictionaries in Python is a data structure, used to store values in key:value format. This makes it different from lists, tuples, and arrays as in a dictionary each key has an associated value.
# Create a Dictionary
  * A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by a ‘comma’.
  
  * The dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.
  
  * Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
  * A dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing curly braces{}.
