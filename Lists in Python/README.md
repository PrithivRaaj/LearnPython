# Python Lists
Python Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). In simple language, a Python list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas. 
  * Ordered collection of data.
  * Lists are mutable type of datastructure
  * It can contain multiple type of data
  * Lists are iterable
  * List can be created using "[]" square brackets or by inbuilt function "list()" example L=[1,2,3] L is a list
# Accessing elements from the List
In order to access the list items refer to the index number. Use the index operator [ ] to access an item in a list. The index must be an integer. Nested lists are accessed using nested indexing. 
# Getting the size of Python list
Python len() is used to get the length of the list.
# Taking Input of a Python List
We can take the input of a list of elements as string, integer, float, etc. But the default one is a string.
# Adding Elements to a Python List
There are two methods:
 * Using append() method
 * Using insert() method
 * Using extend() method
  # Using append() method
   Elements can be added to the List by using the built-in append() function. Only one element at a time can be added to the list by using the append() method, for the addition of multiple elements with the
   append() method, loops are used.Tuples can also be added to the list with the use of the append method because tuples are immutable. Unlike Sets, Lists can also be added to the existing list with the use of
   the append() method.
  # Using insert() method
   append() method only works for the addition of elements at the end of the List, for the addition of elements at the desired position, insert() method is used. Unlike append() which takes only one argument, the
   insert() method requires two arguments(position, value). 
  # Using extend() method
   Other than append() and insert() methods, thereâ€™s one more method for the Addition of elements, extend(), this method is used to add multiple elements at the same time at the end of the list.
