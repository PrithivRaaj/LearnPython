# Tuples in Python
Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable, unlike the Python list which is mutable.

# Creating Python Tuples
There are various ways by which you can create a tuple in Python. They are as follows:

* Using round brackets
* With one item
* Tuple Constructor
# Create Tuples using Round Brackets ()
To create a tuple we will use () operators.
# Create a Tuple With One Item
Python 3.11 provides us with another way to create a Tuple.
# Tuple Constructor in Python
To create a tuple with a Tuple constructor, we will pass the elements as its parameters.
# What is Immutable in Tuples?
Tuples in Python are similar to Python lists but not entirely. Tuples are immutable and ordered and allow duplicate values. Some Characteristics of Tuples in Python.

* We can find items in a tuple since finding any item does not make changes in the tuple.
* One cannot add items to a tuple once it is created. 
* Tuples cannot be appended or extended.
* We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created.
# Accessing Values in Python Tuples
Tuples in Python provide two ways by which we can access the elements of a tuple.

* Using a positive index
* Using a negative index
Python Access Tuple using a Positive Index
Using square brackets we can get the values from tuples in Python.
