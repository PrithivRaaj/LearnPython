# Tuples in Python
Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable, unlike the Python list which is mutable.

# Creating Python Tuples
There are various ways by which you can create a tuple in Python. They are as follows:

* Using round brackets
* With one item
* Tuple Constructor
# Create Tuples using Round Brackets ()
To create a tuple we will use () operators.
# Create a Tuple With One Item
Python 3.11 provides us with another way to create a Tuple.
# Tuple Constructor in Python
To create a tuple with a Tuple constructor, we will pass the elements as its parameters.
# What is Immutable in Tuples?
Tuples in Python are similar to Python lists but not entirely. Tuples are immutable and ordered and allow duplicate values. Some Characteristics of Tuples in Python.

* We can find items in a tuple since finding any item does not make changes in the tuple.
* One cannot add items to a tuple once it is created. 
* Tuples cannot be appended or extended.
* We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created.
# Accessing Values in Python Tuples
Tuples in Python provide two ways by which we can access the elements of a tuple.

* Using a positive index
* Using a negative index

Python Access Tuple using a Positive Index

Using square brackets we can get the values from tuples in Python.

Access Tuple using Negative Index

In the above methods, we use the positive index to access the value in Python, and here we will use the negative index within [].

# Different Operations Related to Tuples
Below are the different operations related to tuples in Python:

* Concatenation
* Nesting
* Repetition
* Slicing
* Deleting
* Finding the length
* Multiple Data Types with tuples
* Conversion of lists to tuples
* Tuples in a Loop
  
Concatenation of Python Tuples

To Concatenation of Python Tuples, we will use plus operators(+).

Nesting of Python Tuples

A nested tuple in Python means a tuple inside another tuple.

Repetition Python Tuples

We can create a tuple of multiple same elements from a single element in that tuple.

Slicing Tuples in Python

Slicing a Python tuple means dividing a tuple into small tuples using the indexing method.

Deleting a Tuple in Python

In this example, we are deleting a tuple using ‘del’ keyword. The output will be in the form of error because after deleting the tuple, it will give a NameError.

Finding the Length of a Python Tuple

To find the length of a tuple, we can use Python’s len() function and pass the tuple as the parameter.

Multiple Data Types With Tuple

Tuples in Python are heterogeneous in nature. This means tuples support elements with multiple datatypes.

Converting a List to a Tuple

We can convert a list in Python to a tuple by using the tuple() constructor and passing the list as its parameters.

Tuples in a Loop

We can also create a tuple with a single element in it using loops.
